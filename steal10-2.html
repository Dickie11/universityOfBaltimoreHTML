	<body><p><h3>
		John tells the man to give him everything in his pockets but the man does not oblige, the man further</br>
		humiliates John. John balls his fist and attemps to strike the man. John did'nt know that the man was</br>
		carrying a knife and was gripping it in his coat pocket during this exchange. Before Johns strike landed</br>
		he saw the gleam of the blade. It was at this moment John realized that he had screwed up. Johns strike never</br> landed. John was stabbed and bled out and died at Chimney Rock that night.
