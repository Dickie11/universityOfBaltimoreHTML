		Dreams Have Meaning</h2>

		<p>In what we may term <q>prescientific days</q> people were in no
		uncertainty about the interpretation of dreams. When they were recalled
		after awakening they were regarded as either the friendly or hostile
		manifestation of some higher powers, demoniacal and Divine. With the
		rise of scientific thought the whole of this expressive mythology was
		transferred to psychology; to-day there is but a small minority among
		educated persons who doubt that the dream is the dreamer's own psychical
		act.</p>
		
		<p>But since the downfall of the mythological hypothesis an
		interpretation of the dream has been wanting. The conditions of its
		origin; its relationship to our psychical life when we are awake; its
		independence of disturbances which, during the state of sleep, seem to
		compel notice; its many peculiarities repugnant to our waking thought;
		the incongruence between its images and the feelings they engender; then
		the dream's evanescence, the way in which, on
		awakening, our thoughts thrust it aside as something bizarre, and our
		reminiscences mutilating or rejecting it&mdash;all these and many other
		problems have for many hundred years demanded answers which up till now
		could never have been satisfactory. Before all there is the question as
		to the meaning of the dream, a question which is in itself double-sided.
		There is, firstly, the psychical significance of the dream, its position
		with regard to the psychical processes, as to a possible biological
		function; secondly, has the dream a meaning&mdash;can sense be made of
		each single dream as of other mental syntheses?</p>
		
		<p>Three tendencies can be observed in the estimation of dreams. Many
		philosophers have given currency to one of these tendencies, one which
		at the same time preserves something of the dream's former
		over-valuation. The foundation of dream life is for them a peculiar
		state of psychical activity, which they even celebrate as elevation to
		some higher state. Schubert, for instance, claims: <q>The dream is the
		liberation of the spirit from the pressure of external nature, a
		detachment of the soul from the fetters of matter.</q> Not all go so far as
		this, but many maintain that dreams have their origin in real spiritual
		excitations, and are the outward manifestations of spiritual powers
		whose free movements have been hampered during
		the day (<q>Dream Phantasies,</q> Scherner, Volkelt). A large number of
		observers acknowledge that dream life is capable of extraordinary
		achievements&mdash;at any rate, in certain fields (<q>Memory</q>).</p>
		
		<p>In striking contradiction with this the majority of medical writers
		hardly admit that the dream is a psychical phenomenon at all. According
		to them dreams are provoked and initiated exclusively by stimuli
		proceeding from the senses or the body, which either reach the sleeper
		from without or are accidental disturbances of his internal organs. The
		dream has no greater claim to meaning and importance than the sound
		called forth by the ten fingers of a person quite unacquainted with
		music running his fingers over the keys of an instrument. The dream is
		to be regarded, says Binz, <q>as a physical process always useless,
		frequently morbid.</q> All the peculiarities of dream life are explicable
		as the incoherent effort, due to some physiological stimulus, of certain
		organs, or of the cortical elements of a brain otherwise asleep.</p>
		
		<p>But slightly affected by scientific opinion and untroubled as to the
		origin of dreams, the popular view holds firmly to the belief that
		dreams really have got a meaning, in some way they do foretell the
		future, whilst the meaning can be unravelled in
		some way or other from its oft bizarre and enigmatical content. The
		reading of dreams consists in replacing the events of the dream, so far
		as remembered, by other events. This is done either scene by scene,
		<em>according to some rigid key</em>, or the dream as a whole is replaced by
		something else of which it was a <em>symbol</em>. Serious-minded persons laugh
		at these efforts&mdash;<q>Dreams are but sea-foam!</q></p>
		
		<h2>Self-analysis</h2>
		
		<p>One day I discovered to my amazement that the popular view grounded
		in superstition, and not the medical one, comes nearer to the truth
		about dreams. I arrived at new conclusions about dreams by the use of a
		new method of psychological investigation, one which had rendered me
		good service in the investigation of phobias, obsessions, illusions, and
		the like, and which, under the name <q>psycho-analysis,</q> had found
		acceptance by a whole school of investigators. The manifold analogies of
		dream life with the most diverse conditions of psychical disease in the
		waking state have been rightly insisted upon by a number of medical
		observers. It seemed, therefore, <em>a priori</em>, hopeful to apply to the
		interpretation of dreams methods of investigation which had been tested
		in psychopathological processes. Obsessions and those peculiar
		sensations of haunting dread remain as strange to normal consciousness
		as do dreams to our waking consciousness; their
		origin is as unknown to consciousness as is that of dreams. It was
		practical ends that impelled us, in these diseases, to fathom their
		origin and formation. Experience had shown us that a cure and a
		consequent mastery of the obsessing ideas did result when once those
		thoughts, the connecting links between the morbid ideas and the rest of
		the psychical content, were revealed which were heretofore veiled from
		consciousness. The procedure I employed for the interpretation of dreams
		thus arose from psychotherapy.</p>
		
		<p>This procedure is readily described, although its practice demands
		instruction and experience. Suppose the patient is suffering from
		intense morbid dread. He is requested to direct his attention to the
		idea in question, without, however, as he has so frequently done,
		meditating upon it. Every impression about it, without any exception,
		which occurs to him should be imparted to the doctor. The statement
		which will be perhaps then made, that he cannot concentrate his
		attention upon anything at all, is to be countered by assuring him most
		positively that such a blank state of mind is utterly impossible. As a
		matter of fact, a great number of impressions will soon occur, with
		which others will associate themselves. These will be invariably
		accompanied by the expression of the observer's
		opinion that they have no meaning or are unimportant. It will be at once
		noticed that it is this self-criticism which prevented the patient from
		imparting the ideas, which had indeed already excluded them from
		consciousness. If the patient can be induced to abandon this
		self-criticism and to pursue the trains of thought which are yielded by
		concentrating the attention, most significant matter will be obtained,
		matter which will be presently seen to be clearly linked to the morbid
		idea in question. Its connection with other ideas will be manifest, and
		later on will permit the replacement of the morbid idea by a fresh one,
		which is perfectly adapted to psychical continuity.</p>
		
		<p>This is not the place to examine thoroughly the hypothesis upon which
		this experiment rests, or the deductions which follow from its
		invariable success. It must suffice to state that we obtain matter
		enough for the resolution of every morbid idea if we especially direct
		our attention to the <em>unbidden</em> associations <em>which disturb our
		thoughts</em>&mdash;those which are otherwise put aside by the critic as
		worthless refuse. If the procedure is exercised on oneself, the best
		plan of helping the experiment is to write down at once all one's first
		indistinct fancies.</p>
