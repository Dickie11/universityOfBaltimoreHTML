	<body><p><h3>
		John walks down the meandering sweet water river untill he reaches a giant rock. He notices rough characters</br>
		carved into the red granite and is struck by the emmence size of the rock formation. At the rock he is approached</br>
		by a man (quite) hungover looking. He tells you he has run out of money and is trying to make it home. John</br>
		questions him with scepticism knowing the amount of money flowing out of California. The man deflects John's</br>
		questions eventually refusing to answer. John has had enough and gets up to leave when the man grabs John's </br>
		sleave and pleads to join him on his way back west. John thinks carefully before answering.
