			<p id="intro">Few insects in our climes vie in popular fame with the <span class = "w">Glow-worm</span>,
			that curious little animal which, to celebrate the little joys of
			life, kindles a beacon at its tail-end. Who does not know it, at
			least by name? Who has not seen it roam amid the grass, like a spark
			fallen from the moon at its full? The Greeks of old called it [Greek:
			lampouris], meaning, the bright-tailed. Science employs the same
			term: it calls the lantern-bearer, <em>Lampyris noctiluca</em>, LIN. In this
			case, the common name is inferior to the scientific phrase, which,
			when translated, becomes both expressive and accurate.</p>

			<p>In fact, we might easily cavil at the word <q><span class = "w">worm</span>.</q> The Lampyris is
			not a <span class = "w">worm</span> at all, not even in general appearance. He has six short
			legs, which he well knows how to use; he is a gad-about, a
			trot-about. In the adult state, the male is correctly garbed in
			wing-cases, like the true Beetle that he is. The female is an
			ill-favoured thing who knows naught of the delights of flying: all
			her life long, she retains the larval shape, which, for the rest, is
			similar to that of the male, who himself is imperfect so long as he
			has not achieved the maturity that comes with pairing-time. Even in
			this initial stage, the word <q><span class = "w">worm</span></q> is out of place. We French have
			the expression <q>Naked as a <span class = "w">worm</span>,</q> to point to the lack of any
			defensive covering. Now the Lampyris is clothed, that is to say, he
			wears an epidermis of some consistency; moreover, he is rather richly
			coloured: his body is dark brown all over, set off with pale pink on
			the thorax, especially on the lower surface. Finally, each segment is
			decked at the hinder edge with two spots of a fairly bright red. A
			costume like this was never worn by a <span class = "w">worm</span>.</p>
