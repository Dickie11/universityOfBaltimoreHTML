		<p><h3>in the year 1851 word had finally reached John Smith about James W. Marshall's discovery of gold</br>
		in Sutters Mill, California. People on the west coast were claiming to get rich from the precious metal.</br>
		After much consideration and debate, John Smith left his family in Missouri to become a 49'er and to persue</br> the riches men were speaking of found in California.It has been 14 months since he left home. He has had some</br> luck and has aquired a modest amount of gold, enought to pay for the equipment he had to loan to mine the gold.</p></h3>
