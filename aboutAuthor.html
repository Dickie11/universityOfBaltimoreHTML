		<h2>Welcome Visitor,</h2>

		Born in Baltimore, MD in 1961 but also having been raised a at least an equal portion of my formative years in Ivor, VA, I was afforded the privilege to experience both; the rural and urban atmospheres on intimate levels which in turn has allowed me to be able to openly and confidently indulge most social venues.

		My education has been garnered and honed through various measures of “Life Experience” verses a more formal setting although I did obtain my G.E.D. in 1979. Such as it was, the lessons were for the most part; intense, clear and at times unforgiving but always poignant. 

		The purpose of this site is to share some of my interests, perspectives, trials and hopes with a fitting respect for you (the visitor) along with your views and feedback that will provide a forum that will; enlighten, encourage and empower in appropriate measure, all who endeavor.

		Although a general outline will provide a basic structure for this page, I welcome any material for discussion that is presented in a tactful and non-offensive manner (intended or otherwise) for exploration, conformation and innovation along the lines of; history, culinary and entertainment just to name a few of the topics of interest that I look forward to sharing with you.

		So until the next time that we are so fortunate to share a space & time, may peace and blessings abound in your endeavors...
