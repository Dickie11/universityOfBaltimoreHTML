	<body><p><h3>
		John begins begging all of the travelers coming in from the east and traveling back from the west. He feels shame</br>
		but the shame of begging to him is nothing compared to the shame of not making it home to his family.</br>
		</br>
		John continues begging to no avail, a man traveling back east humiliates John and further depletes his moral.</br>
		John enraged has a choice to make, say "to hell with this begging" and rob the man that humiliated him or </br>
		continue to beg for money to get home.
